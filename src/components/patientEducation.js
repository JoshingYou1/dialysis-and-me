                    <p className="patient-education-p">
                        Patient education involves healthcare professionals teaching patients about their health so they may better understand their
                        condition. The overall aim of patient education is to improve individual health as well as enhance the performance of the
                        healthcare industry as a whole. Here are some of the benefits that patient education provides:
                    </p>
                    <h2 className="patient-education-h2">Increased Patient Understanding</h2>
                    <p className="patient-education-p">
                        Patient education ensures that patients are well-informed about their own health. This could mean teaching them about the
                        side-effects of their condition, discussing their diagnosis, going through possible treatment options or looking at ways to
                        prevent their condition from deteriorating. This level of understanding could reduce a patientâ€™s anxiety and could also
                        build trust between patient and care provider. An increased understanding puts patients in a better position to make informed
                        decisions regarding their healthcare.
                    </p>
                    <h2 className="patient-education-h2">More active approach to healthcare</h2>
                    <p className="patient-education-p">
                        An educated patient may also be able to self-manage certain elements of their care. Obviously there will always be certain aspects
                        of care that only professionals can administer, but some elements could be managed by the patient, which would relieve some of the
                        burden from providers.
                    </p>
                    <h2 className="patient-education-h2">Enhanced motivation and better outcomes</h2>
                    <p className="patient-education-p">
                        If a patient is well educated on their condition, they will no doubt understand what goals they need to work towards in order to
                        improve their health. In this case, educated patients could be more motivated to reach certain healthcare goals, which would in
                        turn improve their overall health more quickly and more efficiently.
